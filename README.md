# qrtransfer

This is a proof-of-concept project, implemented in Rust WebAssembly.

## How to Use

![Demo](demo.gif)

1. Open [https://qrtransfer.westxu.com](https://qrtransfer.westxu.com) on your PC, select file, zoom/adjust the browser window as you wish. Note that this site is static, which means the file will be processed natively in your browser and won't be uploaded to any server.
2. Open [https://qrtransfer.westxu.com](https://qrtransfer.westxu.com) on your phone, scan using your camera. until finishing scanning all the qrcodes, and then save the reassembled file.

## Note

If your browser somehow couldn't access local files, download an offline version from [release](https://github.com/WestXu/qrtransfer/releases).

The transfer speed is ~1KB/s. I know, but it works.
